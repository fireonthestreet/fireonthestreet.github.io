Nobody.</a> There is no revolution on the horizon, there is no grand idea that will finally awaken humanity to its potential and free us from our chains. There is no vanguard, no purpose, no secret method we can all use to magically make the powerful resign themselves to the fate of ordinary existence. There have been pretenders. There are priests and pimps and false gods that call on you to worship them. There are those who refuse any action without every detail planned out. Who will run the schools, who will build the roads, how will tire fires and blockades raise our carbon footprint? They will call your plans starry-eyed, impractical. Occupy failed, Standing Rock failed.<a class="tm-color-secondary"> All that’s left is you and me.</a></p>

Instead of finding fault with the entire concept of “the law”, as we have patriarchy, slavery, and child abuse, we still worship a concept that has continually failed us; while ignoring the very real evidence that human beings can live in large groups without any law, judiciary, or legislation. <a class="tm-color-secondary">Human interaction is all personal relations.</a> Always has been. Everything else is playing pretend. Some of us are comfortable with accepting that and <a class="tm-color-secondary">some of us are going to keep hoping for a better tomorrow, a better human, and a higher evolved consciousness. That day may very well come.</a>
